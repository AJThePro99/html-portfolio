<h1>My Favourite Movies of All Time</h1>

<h2>The top 3 movies are</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Spiderman Into the Spider Verse</h3>
<p>This was the only movie of them all, to actually change the way I think. <br />
None of the other movies I've watched even came close to this. <br />
I really love the art style as well. It's unique.</p>

<h3>Real Steel</h3>
<p>The one movie that actually was fun to watch. Highly Recommend.</p>

<h3>Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows</h3>
<p>Incredible camerawork, great story and incredible skill by RDJ, as Sherlock Holmes.</p>
